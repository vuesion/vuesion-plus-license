# Personal License

Werner-Most Ideen GmbH grants you an ongoing, non-exclusive license to use the Components.

The license grants permission to one individual (the Licensee) to access and use the Components.

You **can**:

- Modify the Components to create derivative components. Those components are subject to this license.
- Use the Components to create one End Product for one Client that **doesn't** charge End Users.
- Use the Components to create one End Product where the End Product is **not** sold to End Users.
- Use the Components to create End Products that are open source and freely available to End Users.

You **cannot**:

- Use the Components to create End Products that are designed to allow an End User to build their own End Products using the Components or derivatives of the Components.
- Re-distribute the Components or derivatives of the Components separately from an End Product, neither in code nor as design assets.
- Share your access to the Components with any other individuals.

## Example usage

Examples of usage **allowed** by the license:

- Creating a personal website by yourself
- Creating a website or web application for a client that will be owned by that client but **doesn't** charge End Users.
- Creating a web application where the primary purpose is clearly not to simply re-distribute the components (like a conference organization app that uses the components for its UI for example) that is free and open source, where the source code is publicly available.

Examples of usage **not allowed** by the license:

- Creating a repository of your favorite Vuesion+ Components (or derivatives based on Vuesion+ Components) and publishing it publicly.
- Creating a React or Angular version of Vuesion+ Components and making it available either for sale or for free.
- Create a Figma or Sketch UI kit based on the Vuesion+ Component designs.
- Creating a "website builder" project where end users can build their own websites using components included with or derived from Vuesion+ Components.
- Creating a theme, template, or project starter kit using the components and making it available either for sale or for free.
- Creating an admin panel tool (like Laravel Nova or ActiveAdmin) that is made available either for sale or for free.

In simple terms, use Vuesion+ Components for anything you like except for projects that compete with Vuesion+ Components and would have a negative impact on our product sales ✌️
